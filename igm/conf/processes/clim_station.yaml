clim_station:
  update_freq: 1
  # Help : Update the climate fields and thus the mass balance each X years (1 by default)

  zero_degree_isotherm: 2405.0
  # Help : Elevation at which mean annual temperature is 0째C (in m a.s.l.)

  adiabatic_lapse_rate: 0.005695
  # Help : Adiabatic lapse rate for air temperature (in 째C m-1)

  air_temperature_stdev: 2.0
  # Help : The space-independent standard deviation of the daily temperature variability (in Kelvin)

  precipitation_lapse_rate: 3.0
  # Help : Change in precipitation with altitude (in % / 100m): that is, in % / 100m of the given reference_precipitation value.

  reference_precipitation_elevation: 680.0
  # Help : Elevation (m a.s.l.) at which mean annual precipitation rate is known (e.g. a weather station)

  reference_precipitation: 780.0
  # Help : Mean precipitation rate (in mm yr-1) where it is known (e.g. a weather station)

  min_precipitation_allowed: 1.0
  # Help : Minimum allowed precipitation (mm yr-1) to avoid unrealistically low (e.g. negative) values

  cosine_yearly_cycle_temp: True
  # Help : Keep the temperature constant through the year ('False'), or make an ideal seasonal sinusoidal signal of temperature ('True')

  cosine_yearly_cycle_amplitude: 5.0
  # Help : Amplitude of the cosine-based seasonal temperature variation, defining the maximum excursion from the mean annual temperature (in 째C (or Kelvin)).

  southern_hemisphere_climate: False
  # Help : Set to 'True' for Southern Hemisphere hydrological year (May - April cycle) and optional seasonal cycle (warmest temperatures in January).

  export_climate_ref: True
  # Help : Set to 'True' to export a NetCDF file called 'climate_ref.nc' which allows to view the climate fields produced just from topography and 
  #        user-define climate parameters (prior to updating climate due to changing ice surface elevation as simulation is running).

  time_dependent_climate: True
  # Help : Keep climate constant ('False'), or make it change in time ('True') and thus use the user-given climate_change_array
