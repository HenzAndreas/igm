tracking_method:
  Type: str
  Units: [dimensionless]
  Description: Method for tracking particles (3d or simple)
frequency_seeding:
  Type: float
  Units: y
  Description: Frequency of seeding
density_seeding:
  Type: float
  Units: [dimensionless]
  Description: Density of seeding (1 means we seed all pixels, 0.2 means we seed each 5 grid cell, etc.)
tlast_seeding_init:
  Type: float
  Units: y
  Description: Initialize the date of last seeding. If default value, the seeding will start the first year of the simulation. Changing this value allows to defer it
write_trajectories:
  Type: bool
  Units: [dimensionless]
  Description: Write the trajectories of the particles
add_topography:
  Type: bool
  Units: [dimensionless]
  Description: Add topg when writing particles
