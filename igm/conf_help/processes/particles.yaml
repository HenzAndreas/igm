seeding:
  method: 
    Type: str
    Units: dimless
    Description: Method for seeding particles (accumulation or all)
  frequency: 
    Type: float
    Units: y
    Description: Frequency of seeding
  density: 
    Type: float
    Units: dimless
    Description: Density of seeding (1 means we seed all pixels, 0.2 means we seed each 5 grid cell, etc.)
  tlast_init: 
    Type: float
    Units: y
    Description: Initialize the date of last seeding. If default value, the seeding will start the first year of the simulation. Changing this value allows to defer it
  height: 
    Type: float
    Units: dimless
    Description: Height of the seeding layer in the method full
tracking:
  method: 
    Type: str
    Units: dimless
    Description: Method for tracking particles (3d or simple)
  library: 
    Type: str
    Units: dimless
    Description: Library used for tracking (cuda, tensorflow, etc.)
removal:
  method: 
    Type: str
    Units: dimless
    Description: Method for removing particles (ablation, etc.)
output:
  library: 
    Type: str
    Units: dimless
    Description: Library used for outputting particles (numpy, pyvista, etc.)
  add_topography: 
    Type: boolean
    Units: dimless
    Description: Add topography when writing particles
  format: 
    Type: str
    Units: dimless
    Description: Type of output format for particles (csv, parquet)
  add_fields:
    Type: list
    Units: dimless
    Description: List of fields to write in the output file (englt, velbar, weight)
