### <h1 align="center" id="title">The Instructed Glacier Model (IGM) -- 2.0 </h1>

# Overview   

IGM simulates the ice dynamics, surface mass balance, and its coupling through mass conservation to predict the **evolution of glaciers, icefields, or ice sheets**. The specificity of IGM is that it models the ice flow by a **Neural Network**, which is trained from ice flow physics. As a result, IGM permits **user-friendly**, **highly-efficient**, and **mechanically state-of-the-art** glacier simulations with **data assimilation / inversion** capability. IGM is a **modular** open-source **Python** package, which runs across both **CPU and GPU** and deals with **two-dimensional gridded** input and output data. 
  
# Documentation

IGM's documentation can be found on the dedicated [wiki](https://github.com/jouvetg/igm2/wiki).
  
# Quick start

The easiest and quickest way is to get to know IGM is to run notebooks in [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jouvetg/igm2/), which offers free access to GPU, or to install IGM on your machine, and start with examples.
